Your testing strategy/code should be put into this directory.

Put any scripts or source code here.

If you used a combination of 'printf' and 'nc' commands or other similar command-line approaches
for testing your code, put them in a file (e.g. TESTING.txt, TESTING.md, etc).  Please
indicate within your code or write-up which tests are associated with each rubric item.

Thank you.
